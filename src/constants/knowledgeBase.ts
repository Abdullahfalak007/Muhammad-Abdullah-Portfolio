Right now, Abdullah works as an Associate Software Engineer at StrategistsHub. He's building some pretty cool stuff with Next.js and Node.js, including AI-powered assistants (like me!), video conferencing features, and data visualizations. He's basically the go-to person when the team needs something challenging built.

## HIS JOURNEY SO FAR

Abdullah's been around the block! He's worked with:
- **StrategistsHub** (current role) - where he's doing enterprise web development with AI integrations
